On 26 November 1968, Auto Union invited dealers and the press to
attend the presentation of the newly designed Audi 100 at the
Ingolstadt City Theatre. This model, developed by technical
director Dr. Ludwig Kraus, took Audi into the competitive market
segment of the upper mid-size class for the first time. The Audi
100 quickly became a bestseller and formed the basis for a new Audi
model series that ensured the future independence of the Audi
brand.<br />

In March 1980, a four-wheel drive sports coup√© caused a genuine
sensation on the Audi stand at the Geneva Motor Show. The Audi
quattro was the first high-performance vehicle with four-wheel
drive. This drive concept had previously only been used on trucks
and off-road vehicles. The permanent four-wheel drive system in the
Audi quattro enjoyed worldwide success in motor sport and gradually
found its way into the entire Audi model range.<br />

In 1988 AUDI AG ventured into the premium class for the first time
with the launch of the Audi V8. This new model was fitted with a
184 kW (250 bhp) 3.6-litre eight-cylinder alloy engine. Technical
details included permanent four-wheel drive, four valves per
cylinder and a four-speed, electronically controlled automatic
transmission.<br />

In March 1994, AUDI AG presented its new model in the premium
segment, the Audi A8, at the Geneva Motor Show. This was the first
production model with all-aluminium body. At the same time a new
naming process was introduced for the Audi models. From then on the
Audi 80 was known as the A4, the Audi 100 was called the A6. They
were followed in 1996 by the Audi A3, the first representative of
the compact class. Production of the Audi A2, the first
volume-built aluminium car, commenced in June 2000.<br />]]></desc>
