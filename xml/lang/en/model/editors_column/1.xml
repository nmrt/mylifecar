<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">
    <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Interesting, isn&#39;t it, that
    the old- school car, the veddy much more mature Bentley Arnage,
    topped out the category in a three-way shootout between the
    Maybach and the new Rolls-Royce Phantom. So what does this say
    about ultra-luxury buyers?</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">
    <span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is a new category to the
    America&#39;s Best survey primarily because this is a renewed
    category to America. Maybe these carmakers know something about
    the economic warp and woof that we don&#39;t, but introducing
    not one but three (two Maybachs plus the BMW-designed Rolls)
    all-new $300,000-plus luxury sedans to the world seems
    over-the-top- especially in this economic environment.
    Regardless, it is something to see that the AutoWeek enthusiast
    didn&#39;t succumb to the glamorous and glitzy, but opted with
    a tried-and-true blue blood. Could it be a rub-off thanks to
    the Bentley&#39;s recent Le Mans win? Could it be that
    discriminating tastes like traditional design when it comes to
    their house-on-wheels choice? We can&#39;t answer that, but we
    do know this segment will not evaporate, and with the advent of
    a new Bentley sedan on the horizon it will be an even more
    interesting vote in the future.</span>
