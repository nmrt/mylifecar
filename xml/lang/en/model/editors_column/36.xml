    Cadillac CTS sedan:
</h3>
<br />
Engine: 3.2-liter, 220-h.p. V-6;
<br />
Fuel economy: 18 m.p.g. city/20 highway.
<br />
Not a Chevy in disguise, but rather an all-new rear-wheel-drive,
entry-level luxury sedan with dynamic styling to be shared with a
host of future models coming out in the next 18 months. Beefed-up
V-6 teamed with a 5-speed manual as standard, in part to keep base
price less than $30,000. With options, however, such as $1,200
automatic, expect to spend about $35,000. RWD for Snow Belt?
Don&#39;t worry, four-wheel ABS and an all-speed traction control
are standard and sure-footed StabiliTrak is optional with sport
package recommended for serious drivers. Side air bag curtains also
standard. Styling, performance, room, comfort and luxury amenities
to win over younger buyers.
