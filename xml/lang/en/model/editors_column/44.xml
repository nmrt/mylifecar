    Hybrid:&nbsp;</span>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Base price: $21,000
    estimated; Engine: 1.3-liter, 85-h.p. gasoline and 13-h.p.
    electric motor ; Fuel economy: 48 m.p.g. city/48 highway. A
    gas/electric hybrid that doesn&#39;t look or act differently
    than gas only model. Very consumer friendly and a well
    recognized name, which should help gives hybrids consumer
    acceptance. With a combination of gas and electric, your
    driving range isn&#39;t limited because the batteries recharge
    as you drive, instead of stopping for a lengthy recharge as
    with battery-power only. Superb mileage and reduced emissions.
    Nice car to have regardless of whether gas is $1 or $2 a
    gallon. Paves way for even larger hybrids. Will
    environmentalists put money where mouth is?&nbsp;</span>
