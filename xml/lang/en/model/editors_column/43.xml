    <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Honda Accord Hybrid</span>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Engine: 3-liter, 240-hp V-6
    with 12-kilowatt, 144-volt, 16-hp, electric</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Fuel economy: 29 mpg

<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Call it a dual-mode
    gas/electric because it offers not only battery power to propel
    it to reduce the load on the gas engine, it also shuts off
    three cylinders when not needed to conserve even more fuel. The
    switch from six to three cylinders is seamless. There&#39;s no
    jolt or sudden loss of power. If a flashing green
    &quot;eco&quot; light in the instrument panel didn&#39;t alert
    you to 3-cylinder mode, you&#39;d never notice the magic had
    taken place. At about 50 mph, the &quot;eco&quot; light flashes
    on. With a steady foot, you can get to almost 65 mph in
    3-cylinder mode. At stoplights, the gas engine shuts off. Step
    on the accelerator, it restarts and off you go _ quickly,
    quietly and smoothly.</span>

<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Accord is rated at 29 mpg
    city/37 highway, nowhere near the 57 mpg city/56 highway of a
    1-liter, 3-cylinder Insight, nor close to the 48 mpg city/47
    highway of a 1.3-liter, 4-cylinder Civic Hybrid, but still much
    better than the 21/30 from a conventional 3-liter, V-6 Accord.
    The hybrid is priced at a $3,300 premium over regular
    Accord.</span>
