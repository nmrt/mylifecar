    Bentley is the sporting marque: That&#39;s why it raced at
    Sebring. The Arnage is built to be hustled. There&#39;s
    amazingly little body roll considering the altitude of the
    center of gravity, and much grip. The Arnage has just a shade
    less torque than the Maybach, delivered via the meaty-sounding
    V8&#39;s savagely steep boost curve. It is the most dramatic
    performer here; indeed it&#39;s sometimes tricky to mete out
    the acceleration with precision. You&#39;re strapped aboard a
    force of nature. That&#39;s the Bentley&#39;s appeal.

    <font size="3"><font color="#000000">The Arnage&#39;s body and
    interior furniture are most traditional; stately, physically
    heavy, obviously and delightfully handmade. There&#39;s also
    less space. Although you sit high, the roof is comparatively
    low and the windshield small, the doors and console close. You
    feel like a big man filling a big car.</font></font></span>
