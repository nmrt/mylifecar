<p class="mt">"I believe that people buy Toyota because they find
high quality in every aspect of the company," former Toyota Motor
Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (TMS) Executive Vice President Robert B.
McCurry once said.&nbsp; Since TMS was first established 50 years
ago, its tireless pursuit of quality across all areas of business,
including products, design, engineering, production, management and
dealerships, has been the key to the company's successful
brand-building in the U.S.</p>
<p class="mt">The story of TMS began in October 1957, shortly after
its first-ever import, the Toyopet Crown, hit U.S. shores.&nbsp;
The Toyopet was popular in its homeland and performed well on
Japan's narrow, winding streets, but it was unsuited to America's
vast highways.&nbsp; As a result, the company began to encounter
difficulties in its new market.</p>
<p class="mt">So TMS took a good look at the source of its
business: people.&nbsp; What was driving their choice in
cars?&nbsp; It saw that while Toyota had a good product in the
Toyopet, Americans were looking for a nimbler and more powerful
vehicle to help them go about their daily business.&nbsp; To be
successful in America, Toyota would have to adapt to suit local
needs.</p>
